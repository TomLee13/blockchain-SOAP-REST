# Blockchain Transaction Simulation
Simulation of blockchain using both SOAP and RESTful API.  

The Block.java and BlockChain.java file under the root directory is the defination of the blockchain API. It should be added to the server side directory for every task.  

## Task1
Design and implement a SOAP based blockchain API. The goal is to build a JAX-WS RPC-style web-service.
## Task2
Design and implement a SOAP based blockchain API. The goal is to build a JAX-WS single message style web-service. In this implementation, 
I chose CSV as the format.
## Task3
Design and implement a RESTful blockchain API. The client side code used a proxy design.
