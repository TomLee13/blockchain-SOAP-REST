# Blockchain Transaction Simulation
Simulation of blockchain using both SOAP and RESTful API.
## Task1
Design and implement a SOAP based blockchain API. The goal is to build a JAX-WS RPC-style web-service.
## Task2
Design and implement a SOAP based blockchain API. The goal is to build a JAX-WS single message style web-service. In this implementation, 
I chose CSV as the format.
## Task3
